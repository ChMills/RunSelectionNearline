# RunSelectionNearline
Nearline client for run selection

---------------------------------

TO DO

- Force to wait until DQ tables have been created
- Edit parser depending on what the actual run selection code requires, at the moment just takes run number
- Currently assumes that the run selection code returns a ratdb file that is saved to disk - check this?
- Check location of settings file on nearline
- Check all file paths when running nearline
